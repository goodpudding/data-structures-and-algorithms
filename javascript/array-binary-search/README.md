# Reverse an array

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

I figured it would just need a for loop to itterate through the array for the length of it and then for each index run an if statement that checks if the incoming number is equal to the current index and if so, return the index. If not, return -1.
